**Goal:** The goal of this project is to provide all the Zip Codes located within the input radius of each city mentioned.  

**The scope is:** After you input the cities and the radius, the app searches for the coordinates of each city. It then returns the latitude and longitude for each one. 
Using these outputs (latitude, longitude) along with the input radius, the main URL is generated, and the site is scraped. All the retrieved data is saved in a dataframe, which you can then download.
